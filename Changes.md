# To Do #

  * ~~stop looting on full inventory~~
  * ~~flying off into death when gathering~~
  * stutter step before casting - wtf is this?
  * ~~disappearing phased gathering nodes~~ this is a Blizz problem, not ours
  * run past corpse and not rez
  * corpse run needs to connect to first wp of route
  * combat behaviors tend to require /cleartarget /targetlasttarget
  * % based mana / power etc checks are buggy?
  * mail actions don't (always?) manage to interact with the mailbox
  * mail actions don't (always?) mail all items they should
  * pg cannot be stopped while executing mail actions (usleep blocks the ui thread)
  * waypoint actions are sometimes (always?) executed on the previous waypoint
  * relative coordinate spaces such as the travelers' tundra mammoth vendors and people on boats / zeps
  * dk characters don't attack targets that are engaged with their temporary pet
  * the bot doesn't engage npcs that are engaged with another npc, such as the ones on the th shore (related to the previous one?)
  * ~~the ability to enter a macros text into the route /~~ profile
  * ~~automatic tracking of skill levels would be awesome~~
  * ~~when you create or import a new profile it doesn't appear in the list on the bot tab without restarting pg~~
  * ~~automatic bg queueing~~
  * ~~new pvp zones~~
  * when anti-stuck doesn't work try strafing and/or moving back a little and then strafing
  * ~~the /startattack checkbox under behaviors is not saved~~
  * godmode
  * ~~ignore nearby elites when gathering~~
  * ignore everything while mounted
  * the size of fishing pools pg uses to detect if the bobber landed in a pool could possibly be increased
  * ~~new, smarter ghost routes, automatically chooses the fastest path on your route instead of running all the way through the route~~
  * ~~save button for routes, so pg doesn't have to be closed to save~~
  * ~~gather ANYTHING~~
  * ~~better blacklisting of nodes, character position blacklisting~~
